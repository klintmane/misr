# Memory

There are many types of memories used in a computer, but in it's simplest form, memory refers to the hardware computers use to store information.

The two basic types of memory that most people are familiar with are:

- [ROM](#references) (Read-Only Memory)
- [RAM](#references) (Random Access Memory)

One of the main differences between them - although not always the case, is that RAM is [volative](#references) (information is lost on power loss) while ROM is non-volative.

That main dinstiction leads to the two of them being used for very different purposes.

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

As RAM is volative, it's used for temporary memory. It's used as a temporary storage bin, computer programs use it to store (write) information they might want to use (read) later.

## ROM (Read-Only Memory)

Modern ROM on the other hand, unlike its name suggests, can be written to. It's main goal however, is to store things that aren't meant to change often.

Those are computer programs with a limited/special goal or scope, like [firmware](#references) (eg. [BIOS](#references)) or programs run by [embedded devices](#references).
